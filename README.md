This is a collection of ideas of what I want to do with my kids when they're
older, so I don't forget.

## View Bacteria Growth
Prepare two plates with agar. After playing outside, let them put their hand in
one plate before washing hands. Thoroughly wash hands. Let them touch the other
plate. Put ceran wrap over both plates and incubate. See if there's a
difference.

## Jam Jar Jet
Take old jam jar, make hole in the top, approximately 1cm in diameter. Put
about 10ml of Ethanol (rubbing alcohol) in the bottom. Place jar in waterbath
(when it works, jar will eventually burst, need to not spill burning alcohol
everywhere). Close jar, light at hole. See if can get to run continuously.

## Can Phone
Two tin cans, Nylon string, build a can phone.

## Grow Physarum Polycephalum
... and let it find a route through a labyrinth.
